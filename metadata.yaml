description: "All the Brothers Were Valiant is a 1953 Technicolor adventure drama\
  \ film made by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), based on the 1919 novel All the Brothers\
  \ Were Valiant by Ben Ames Williams.\nThe 1953 MGM film is a remake of the 1923\
  \ silent film that starred Lon Chaney and made by Metro Pictures (a forerunner of\
  \ MGM), that is now considered lost; as is the 1928 MGM version, Across to Singapore,\
  \ which starred Ramon Novarro. The 1953 version is directed by Richard Thorpe and\
  \ produced by Pandro S. Berman from a screenplay by Harry Brown. The music score\
  \ is by Miklós Rózsa, the cinematography by George J. Folsey and the art direction\
  \ is by Randall Duell and Cedric Gibbons.\nIt stars Robert Taylor, Stewart Granger\
  \ and Ann Blyth, with Betta St. John, Keenan Wynn, James Whitmore, Kurt Kasznar,\
  \ Lewis Stone (his final film, released posthumously), John Lupton, and Michael\
  \ Pate.\n\n\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
